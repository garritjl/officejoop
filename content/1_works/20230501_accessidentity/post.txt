Description: access â€” The 2023 VCUarts Fashion Event
May 9, 2023, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts

The VCUarts Departments of Fashion Design and Fashion Merchandising hold an annual juried event showcasing students' most exceptional work; the theme for 2023 was "access."The specified theme of this year's event was "access." (link: https://j-ltf.com/typefaces/impact-nieuw/ text: JL Impact Nieuw 2022 Silver Lining, class: green) a hollow, stroke-only typeface, was chosen to emphasize negative space and plays with the concept of line or stroke representing a barrier that lies between an individual and gaining access, or "permission to explore." The concept also draws from surveillance imagery and thermal camera imagery, which manifests in the purple and green gradient mapping used throughout. Between the thermal graphics, faux-CCTV footage on screens in the event space, and *access*-branded lanyards, attendees are given the sense that access to the event is exclusive, something they personally have been granted.
