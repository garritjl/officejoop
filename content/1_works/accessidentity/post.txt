Description: access â€” The 2023 VCUarts Fashion Event
May 9, 2023, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts

The VCUarts Department of Fashion Design + Merchandising holds an annual juried event showcasing students' most exceptional work; the theme for 2023 was "access." (link: https://j-ltf.com/typefaces/impact-nieuw/ text: JL Impact Nieuw 2022 Silver Lining, class: blue) a hollow, stroke-only typeface, was chosen to emphasize negative space and uses this quality to represent the barrier between an individual and access, or "permission to explore." The identity also draws from surveillance and thermal camera imagery, manifesting in the purple and green gradient map used throughout. The goal was to give attendees the sense that access to the event is exclusive, something they personally have been granted.
